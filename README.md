# classicfriv.github.io
A site for fun games.

Note:
All games belong to their respective owners.

This is classicfriv.github.io, and if you were expecting Friv, no, unfortunately there's nothing related to Friv here.
Why? You might ask, well, when I created this account, I planned to create a static copy of Friv, but Tsyuay already created what I was planning to make. (check out Friv Reborn)
I have developed and collected some games from around the web, some will be new, some will be classics. But no matter what, they will forever be fun.

Note:
For some lines of code, I have used ChatGPT to refine them.
